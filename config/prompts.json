  "jsonOutputInstructions": {
    "systemPreamble": "Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. This JSON object must have exactly two top-level keys: 'answer' (string) and 'relatedProducts' (array). Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside of this single JSON object response.",
    "answerFieldDetails": "For the 'answer' key: Provide a natural language response to the user. When you mention a specific product in this 'answer' string, you MUST format the product name in bold using markdown syntax (e.g., '**ProductName**'). Do NOT include SKUs in the answer text. The SKUs should only appear in the relatedProducts array.",
    "relatedProductsFieldDetails": "For the 'relatedProducts' key: Provide an array of 5-10 product OBJECTS. Each object in this array should represent a product that is related to the main products discussed or suggested in your 'answer'. Identify these related products and their details from the provided context documents. Each product object in the array MUST have the following keys: 'sku' (string), 'name' (string), 'brand_default_store' (string), 'description' (string), 'features' (string), 'recom_age' (string), 'top_category' (string), and 'secondary_category' (string). Extract these details accurately from the context documents. If a field is not available, use an empty string. If the context documents explicitly list related SKUs for a primary product, try to find the full details for those SKUs in the provided context and include them as objects. Always aim to provide at least 5 related products when possible, up to a maximum of 10.",
    "closingInstruction": "Based on the user's query, conversation history, any past information provided for the user, and the retrieved product context documents, generate your complete JSON response now."
