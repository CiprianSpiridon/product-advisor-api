  "jsonOutputInstructions": {
    "systemPreamble": "Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. This JSON object must have exactly two top-level keys: 'answer' (string) and 'relatedProducts' (array). Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside of this single JSON object response.",
    "answerFieldDetails": "For the 'answer' key: Provide a natural language response to the user. When you mention a specific product in this 'answer' string, you MUST format the product name in bold using markdown syntax (e.g., '**ProductName**'). Do NOT include SKUs in the answer text.",
    "relatedProductsFieldDetails": "For the 'relatedProducts' key: Search through all provided context for product SKUs. SKUs often look like 'ZAZ-ZA-ROBIN-01', 'ZAZ-ZA-PHOEBE-01', or similar formats with letters, numbers and hyphens. Extract these exact SKUs and include them in an array. Example: [\"ZAZ-ZA-ROBIN-01\", \"ZAZ-ZA-PHOEBE-01\"]. If you truly cannot find any SKUs in the context, only then return an empty array [].",
    "closingInstruction": "Search the entire context carefully for product SKUs and include them in your response. The format of SKUs may vary but they are unique identifiers like 'ZAZ-ZA-ROBIN-01' found in the product data. Make sure to return any SKUs you find."
